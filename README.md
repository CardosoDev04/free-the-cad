## Why am I doing this?
I used to play FiveM a lot back in the day and I remember most CAD systems being unprofessionally made and costing absolute fortunes for players and server owners that most of the time bought these typeso of products without actually even having enough traffic on their server to pay for it. While I respect the CAD seller's grind (somewhat) I also think there should be a free and open source alternative that can actually be clean and usable.

That's where Free The Cad comes in! I'll be developing this CAD system in my spare time and do it thoughtfully in order for it to be as well crafted as possible, for an indie and free project.
